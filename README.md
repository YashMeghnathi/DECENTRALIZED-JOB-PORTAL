# DECENTRALIZED-JOB-PORTAL
A decentralized job portal connects employers and job seekers directly, using blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and data control without a central authority.

## Overview

The **Decentralized Job Portal** is a smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain to provide a decentralized platform for employers and job seekers. The platform allows employers to post job opportunities, while applicants can apply for these jobs and get rated based on their skills. Admins have the control to add applicants, jobs, and assign ratings, which can then be accessed by anyone on the platform.

## Objective

The primary objective of this decentralized job portal is to:
- Allow job seekers to apply for jobs with full control over their credentials.
- Enable admins to add new applicants and job posts.
- Facilitate ratings for applicants, making it easier for employers to assess candidates.
- Provide transparency and security through blockchain, ensuring no central authority can manipulate the system.

- **Job Applications**: Applicants can apply for jobs and provide additional information to increase their chances.
- **Decentralization**: Powered by blockchain to ensure transparency and data integrity.
